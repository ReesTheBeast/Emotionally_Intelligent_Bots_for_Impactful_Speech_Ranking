The EIBFISR is a Python-based open source tool designed by Rees to analyze and rank speeches by evaluating the emotional intensity and effectiveness of specific traits, such as confidence, empathy, enthusiasm, and authority. This script processes the text of a speech, identifies key emotional indicators through keyword-based analysis, and adjusts the importance of each trait based on the frequency and presence of these keywords. The goal of the EIBFISR is to provide a quantitative assessment of how well a speaker conveys different emotions, which can be used to evaluate public speaking performances or improve speech delivery. The speakers speech is then ranked in an Emotionally driven bot simulation, providing statistical information for nothing.

Key Features:
Emotional Trait Scoring: The script assigns scores to various emotional traits like confidence, empathy, enthusiasm, and authority, based on keywords found in the speech. For instance, words such as "believe", "strong", or "assertive" may indicate confidence, while words like "care", "understand", or "support" could reflect empathy.

Dynamic Trait Weight Adjustment: The script adjusts the importance of each emotional trait based on the context and frequency of related keywords. For example, if a speech uses many keywords related to "empathy" or "understanding", the score for empathy will be higher, reflecting the speaker's emotional tone.

Extensibility: The system is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for the addition of new emotional traits or adjustments to the scoring system. New keywords can be added to the configuration file, and the scoring logic can be modified to suit different applications.

Project Structure:
main.py: The core script that processes the speech text, analyzes emotional traits, and outputs scores and ranks for the speech. It reads the speech input, applies keyword analysis, and generates the emotional trait rankings.

README.md: Documentation that explains how to use the Speech Ranker, configure emotional traits and keywords, and run the script. It also provides installation instructions and examples of how to execute the program.

requirements.txt: Lists the external Python dependencies (such as nltk for natural language processing or re for regular expressions) that need to be installed to run the Speech Ranker.

How It Works:
Keyword Matching: The script first tokenizes the speech text and searches for predefined keywords that are linked to specific emotional traits. For example, words like "I believe", "trust", and "strong" might trigger higher confidence scores, while "listen", "care", or "understand" may increase empathy scores.

Adjusting Trait Weights: Once keywords are detected, the script calculates the weight or score for each emotional trait. If a speech frequently uses keywords linked to empathy, the empathy score will rise, whereas a lack of relevant keywords might result in a lower score for that trait.

Rank Generation: After analyzing the speech, the script generates a ranking for each emotional trait, providing insights into how strongly the speaker conveys each emotion. These rankings help assess the overall emotional effectiveness of the speech.

Customization: The system is flexible and can be adapted to different contexts. Users can update the main.py file to fine-tune the trait-to-keyword mappings, adjust trait importance, or add new emotional traits for analysis.

Execution: To run the EIBFISR, simply provide a speech in text format as an input. The script will then process the speech, adjust the trait weights based on keyword matches, and output the emotional rankings.

Use Cases:
Public Speaking Evaluation: Assess the emotional effectiveness of speeches in competitions, debates, or presentations by ranking the emotional traits.
Speech Coaching: Help speakers identify areas of strength and weakness in their emotional delivery, such as improving empathy or confidence.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply the Speech Ranker to analyze the emotional tone of political speeches, corporate presentations, or motivational talks.
AI/Chatbot Development: Integrate the Speech Ranker into virtual assistants or chatbots to enhance their ability to recognize and respond to emotional cues in human speech.
